THIRD PARTY MODULES
-------------------

As part of developing the required modules for Moodle enhancements, we must import a list of third party items.
We track those here so when Moodle is upgraded, we can obtained updated versions to work with the new Moodle version.

They should also be reviewed as part of bugfix releases to ensure we have upgraded versions of the plugins as well.

Modules not listed here and not in the Moodle core source tree are developed as custom code by Open Universities Australia.

Folder in Moodle	Source Location and hash if git.
